# Game Of pure Strategy

The game of Goofspiel is implemented as part of this project. 

One suit is singled out as the "Prize" ; each of the remaining suits becomes a hand for one player, with one suit discarded if there are only two players.
In our case, the suit of Diamonds is the Prize.  The cards belonging to the sit of Diamonds are shuffled and placed between the players with one card turned up.
